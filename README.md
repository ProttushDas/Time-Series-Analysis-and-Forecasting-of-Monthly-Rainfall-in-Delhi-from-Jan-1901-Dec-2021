This project is a data analysis of the IMDB Movie Dataset, aimed at uncovering insights such as the longest movies, highest-rated movies, highest-grossing movies, and trends in average ratings over time. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to better understand patterns in the film industry.
